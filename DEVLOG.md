# Development Log

## d12022025
setup webserver with node, express, and websockets module.

testing locally using `websocat` tool. 

Sample Tests:
- connect - `{"type":"join","stream":"color-value"}`
- send - `{"type":"data","color":"red","value":128}`

Created a simple frontend example to interact with the server when it was locally hosted for testing. Need to updated with hosted server name later.
